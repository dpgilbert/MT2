gluino = 1000021
LSP = 1000022

T1bbbb: 
* back to back LSPs
* secondary vertices are not in obvious spots because displayed tracks are only PF tracks, not all tracks

T1tttt:
* back to back LSPs
* nice muon (from W decay?)
* what's up with the big photon and electron? Doesn't seem to match gen record in an obvious way.
* Why are ECAL deposits filtered for up quarks by default but not downs? Photon + electron make sense butâ€¦?

T1qqqq:
* LSPs are not back to back, but are boosted down the beam line
* Very compressed; Mgluino = 750, Mchi = 725
* jets are soft in pT due to z boost + small leftover energy due to compressed mass spectrum
